The strong association with lifestyle implicates that the majority of these diseases are preventable or that changing lifestyle plays an important role in the management of these diseases.\r\nA planned approach of disease prevention and health promotion is desirable to develop effective interventions and public health solutions. This approach entails a thorough process from analysing the public health problem, to identifying the lifestyle factors that cause the problem, assessing the relevant behavioural determinants and selecting suitable intervention strategies that are effective and cost-effective.\r\nThis course combines methodological knowledge and skills of randomized controlled trials, systematic reviews, meta- analyses and economic evaluation with knowledge on how to systematically plan, develop and evaluate health behaviour change (lifestyle) programmes.\r\nDuring this course, students will choose their own topic related to lifestyle and chronic disease, conduct a systematic review to evaluate what is already known about this topic, systematically develop an intervention that fills a gap in the literature, and write a research grant proposal for a study evaluating the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of that intervention. Students will make a video knowledge clip that shows how the intervention was developed according to the first steps of the Precede-Proceed model.

Yet the exact nature, beginnings, drawbacks, and benefits of modernity continue to be contested.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAll sides accept, however, that modernity is characterized by (1) the rise of technology, built on a mathematical or quantitative, materialist understanding of (natural) science and (2) secularization and individualism, that is to say: equal rights to protect individual freedom and individual moral autonomy, producing a contractual understanding of political legitimacy.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nModernity is hence generally contrasted with (1) both teleological and supernatural explanations in (natural) science and (2) teleological, theological, or hierarchical understandings of man and society.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nDiscussion in class will revolve around two sets of intertwined questions. First: What is modernity? Is there a specific politics of modernity? If so, how does it differ from the pre-modern? And: What is the relation between modern politics, modern philosophy, and science? Are modern politics the product of modern philosophy and modern science?\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nBehind these two sets of questions we find a third one: Is there a natural order? If so, does the natural order extend beyond science to morality and politics? To what extent can we know this order?\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nHistorically, these questions are intertwined with the rise of liberalism. Indeed, the dominant view is probably that the politics of modernity is liberalism (and the criticisms it has provoked). Nonetheless, liberalism is an essentially contested concept (it has no generally accepted single definition). “Liberalism” means something different in North America than elsewhere. Liberals exist on the left (progressive liberals, distinct from the illiberal left) and on the right (conservative liberals, distinct from the illiberal right). People also distinguish between classical liberals, neoliberals, old school liberals, and Cold War liberals. These different definitions may overlap.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nFor these reasons, to explore the politics of modernity, the course is organized around Stephen Holmes’s book The Anatomy of Antiliberalism. In this book he defends his own understanding of liberalism against six influential thinkers, critical of modernity, which he (hence) considers illiberal. The organization of the course in this way is not meant to endorse Holmes’s views. Instead, his book is meant as a point of departure for exploring the politics of modernity.\r\n\r\nTo avoid strawmen, we will read the six influential thinkers, critical of modernity, in their own words, before we turn to Holmes’s replies. In addition, we will confront Holmes’s defense of liberalism with a defense of modern republicanism. Defenders of modern republicanism see it as a tradition that is modern, but not liberal. In other words, in their view the politics of modernity is not necessarily either liberal or critical of modernity: for them the politics of modernity could also be republican—neither liberal, nor critical of modernity.", "level": 200}}, {"model": "reviews.course", "pk": 110, "fields": {"name": "Nations, Nationalism and Modernity", "code": "900275SSCY", "description": "This course is an introduction to the multidisciplinary field of Nationalism Studies.

Furthermore, students are trained in a number of basic legal skills: consulting the sources of law, reading a judicial decision, interpreting legal rules and arguing to defend a legal claim.\r\n\r\nPart 2 offers an introduction to socio-legal studies. The essence of legal ordering is studied by first tracing its historical development. How did communities first start to use legal rules and concepts? Following Max Weber’s sociology, it is argued that the concept ‘rationalization’ is crucial to understand the emergence of modern legal systems. On its path to more contemporary socio-legal research, this part furthermore visits the work of famous thinkers such as Émile Durkheim, Karl Marx and Pierre Bourdieu, as well as a number of case studies. Among others, it raises the following questions: Is legal ordering a function of solidarity-types? How does legal ordering lead to social change? Does law contribute to social equality, or rather to social inequality? What factors influence legal decisions taken by e.g. judges? Is legal ordering to be seen as an ideology?        \r\n\r\nPart 3 is devoted to the so-called Court of Reason, in which students debate cases that raise ethical dilemmas by playing various roles (judge, counselor and moral advisor). We read Michael Sandel’s much appraised book entitled ‘Justice: What is the Right Thing to Do?” It gives an accessible introduction to a number of influential moral perspectives, as offered by e.g. utilitarianism, deontology and virtue ethics.

We call them ‘core texts’because they have fundamentally shaped the world we live in today. This does not mean that the texts are a sequence of improvements or that they should be read as authorities. Instead, the texts are read in order to help us understand our world, and develop our own thinking about important political questions regarding power, justice, peace, order, and so forth.\r\n\r\nAccording to the classical tradition, the well ordering of society crucially depends on both its citizens and leaders developing a virtuous character. Thinking about politics thus starts with thinking about human nature, human excellence, and the good life. Examples of thinkers in this tradition are Plato and Aristotle.\r\n\r\nWriters from the monotheistic religions in many respects agree with the classical thinkers. But there are also important differences, creating challenges for those who have sought to reconcile the pagan classical authors and religious texts. From the Christian tradition examples of such thinkers are Augustine, Thomas Aquinas, and Christine de Pizan; from the Islamic tradition, Alfarabi; from the Jewish tradition, Moses Maimonides.\r\n\r\nDuring the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, the focus shifts from the moral development of citizens towards the development of institutions that circumscribe the actions of individuals. Thinkers such as Niccolo Machiavelli and Thomas Hobbes argue that ‘realistic’ politics or a strong state are necessary to prevent civil war. In response, others in the tradition of what would later become known as liberalism, such as John Locke and James Madison, share much of Hobbes’ view of human nature, but also argue that as much as the state is necessary to protect the citizens from each other, so a constitution is necessary to protect the people from the state.\r\n\r\nIn the nineteenth century, a discussion of the strengths and weaknesses of liberal-democracy takes center stage, with authors such as Alexis de Tocqueville and John Stuart Mill.

There are two sides to the relation of logic to mathematics. On the one hand, logic is concerned with so-called foundational questions about mathematics. Such questions lead to the development of formal systems that formalise parts of mathematics, e.g. axiomatisations of arithmetic, analysis, geometry etc. A central theme here is the expressive power of a logical system, and, in particular, whether the system is expressive enough to contain the mathematical theory at hand, so that properties of the logic immediately transfer to properties of the mathematical theory. On the other hand, logic is concerned with the proof of meta-mathematical results, such as consistency and decidability of particular formal systems, definability of certain notions of interest etc. These results include limitative theorems which establish the absolute limits of the deductive power of formal systems; a good example here is the famous Halting problem which roughly states that there is no method by means of which it can be decided for arbitrary computer programs whether they will eventually terminate on arbitrary input or run forever. Although such a limitative theorem belongs to theoretical computer science, its implications inform any application of computation as we know it.

Focusing firstly on the system-part of this interaction, we explore a number of traditional theories about the nature and function of legal ordering. These theories raise the question to what extent it is possible, or useful, to conceive of law as an autonomous normative system. Does it not conflict with the fact that law tends to incorporate and reflect new ideas about, for instance, the environment, privacy and medical ethics? To get a better grip on this social influence, we explore the work of adventurous thinkers such as Ronald Dworkin, Pierre Bourdieu and Niklas Luhmann. They will help us explore the interaction between system and lifeworld more in depth. The final part of the course focuses on what Habermas and others call ‘the public sphere’: the social space in which problems of general interest are discussed, and in which collective solutions (as expressed in e.g. legal rules) are found in a communicative manner. Is it realistic to presuppose that citizens are after consensus when they discuss matters in this social space? If not, does it at least make sense to see that type of communication as ideal; as something to strive for? Amongst others, here we will address the work of neo-marxist political theorist Chantal Mouffe, who argues that said ideal disregards the inherent conflictual nature of social life.

Cities continue to grow in number and in size: urbanization has reached unprecedented levels. Many scholars view cities as central building blocks of 'post-industrial' society; others link cities to discussions on 'modernity'. Yet again others view the growth of cities as emblematic of the expanding gap between North and South, East and West.\r\nBut what does ongoing urbanization mean for the lives of ordinary persons living in cities, and of those aspiring to do so? What are the problems and dilemma’s characteristic of social life in the city? This course addresses these questions by presenting a critical review of anthropological and sociological thinking on cities, urban life and urbanization. The course focuses on experiential and organizational aspects of social life in the city, but it also explores how this is embedded in broader societal frames, including the countryside (urban-rural linkages), transnational migration networks, and globalising trade. By taking a comparative perspective (including examples from Western and socalled 'developing' countries), the course surveys the social and cultural diversity in perspectives and practices of city dwellers/urban actors, and discusses different research approaches and traditions to study these meaningfully.\r\n\r\nThe course is organized around two major parts. In the first part, key concepts and debates from the literature (both theoretical debates and case studies) will be discussed in a combination of lectures and student presentations. In this part, students will also view documentary movies highlighting a particular aspect of city life. Furthermore, an excursion will be organised to the renowned New Town Institute in Almere (NTI).

We also trace a phenomenological turn in film studies attending to how the spectator’s body senses, interacts with, and is affected by film, and what this might tell us about the centrality of the body in spectatorship. Next, we consider the import of the depiction of bodies on screen, from fundamental questions around the attractions of the moving body to interventions in critical animal studies, critical race theory, feminist and gender theory, crip studies, and posthumanism around cinematic depictions of particularised bodies.

This religious violence was contested by those who dismissed the use of religion as illegal, and used by others to plea for a peaceful world without religion.

Adapted from biological sciences, an ‘ecology’ is a way of thinking about the dynamics of interconnection, interdependence, attunement, and exchange between organisms and their environment, where the environment, importantly, is understood as active, evolving, and responsive, rather than fixed.  In this course, we will experimentally adapt this framework in thinking about similar dynamics not only within literary and scientific texts, but also in the relationships between them, their impact on each other, and the evolving social, cultural, and political environments which they shape and to which they respond.   \r\n\r\nThrough drawing on literary and scientific texts from a range of historical periods, we will explore the relationships between scientific discovery (in e.g. psychology, neuroscience, evolution, embryology, energy and climate, astronomy, mathematics) and cultural production and representation. We will consider the ways in which imaginative literature in particular, but also art, cinema, and the media, addresses, responds to, and creates popular science, while also considering works of science and scientific debates which make use of literary strategies. Exploring these “literary ecologies” will encourage us to re-examine the relationships between scientific discovery and literary communities in order to gain insight into the role of creativity in scientific discourse and the part literature has to play in reflecting critically on scientific developments in a range of historical and cultural contexts.

As both students and consumers of journalism, you are entering a twenty-first century news landscape that looks nothing like the one your parents (or even your younger selves) grew up with, and will likely look even more different by the time you graduate. Journalism is in many ways in crisis. Politicians regularly use their public platforms to denigrate reporters, denounce media outlets as purveyors of “fake news,” and flout efforts by the press to hold them accountable. Generalized disillusionment and skepticism with “elites” in the news media breed resentment and reactionary anger around the world. In many countries journalists are struggling with both economic and political woes. Many newsrooms—particularly traditional newspapers--face a growing backlash from the public, as well as a near-total financial collapse of their advertisement-driven business model. News organizations generally have fewer resources to do enterprise and investigative projects, and the expansion of digital publishing has brought an onslaught of competition, layoffs, and cost-cutting. For all the changes, the practice of journalism remains largely founded on the principles of one long-standing institution: the newspaper. Newspaper journalism continues to influence the skills and sensibilities of professional journalists, who face the daunting task of learning the tools of the trade and adapting the traditional principles of newspaper journalism for a fast-changing media landscape. With the newspaper as its foundation, this class is designed to develop the basic skills of newswriting, and to give you a more panoramic sense of how the news media operates today, the role of the free press in a democratic society, the vicissitudes of journalism in an age of rising skepticism, and the ethical dilemmas that beset many journalists as they try to navigate an increasingly digital, global, frenetic news cycle. We will also turn a critical eye on our starting point of the newspaper and its received wisdoms. Through readings, in-class activities and discussions, and group and individual assignments, students will report and write on a range of local and regional topics in a range of journalistic styles, including short news reports and reviews, long-form features, and multimedia productions such as podcasts.

The course aims to provide an introduction to foundational methods in the major, through a combination of introduction to the method ‘itself’ and in the practice of engaging the method to analyze an object. The objective is to provide plenty of opportunity to practice working with objects with different methods, thus developing skills to be applied in disciplinary courses and prompting reflections on how a method shapes and even produces our objects of analysis.\r\n\r\nThe design of the course revolves around objects of analysis, presenting a range of objects which students encounter from different methodological perspectives. By relating multiple methods to the same object, students discover how different methods shape the interpretation of an object in different ways, and how no one method can fully or completely ‘explain’ an object. Pairing and combining methods in an unconventional manner outside of a chronological progression, emphasises the relevance of each method for contemporary scholarship and facilitates creative, perhaps unexpected, dialogue between various methodological trajectories within the Humanities. \r\n\r\nAt the same time, it is important that the object-centered course design not be reduced to a module format. Maintaining a ‘backbone’ throughout the course is crucial to the coherence and cohesion of the course. This throughline is comprised of the sustained attention to methods as such. Returning in each cycle of the course to a set of basic guiding questions that reflect on the methods in question and on the notion of method itself provides continuity between the modules of the course and encourages connections between these components.

What is a method? A methodology? How do these relate to research questions?\r\n- What are the objects of the Humanities? What can we do with them?\r\n\r\n• Questions for Encountering an object (first session of each cycle)\r\n- What do you notice about this object? \r\n- What questions does the object prompt for you? \r\n- What ‘is’ this object (how would you initially delineate it, ‘categorize’ it, etc)\r\n\r\n• Questions for Encountering a Method (second and third session of each cycle)\r\n- What is the objective of this method? What does it look for and why?\r\n- What is the starting point, or the grounding assumptions, from which this method proceeds? How do those questions direct a particular mode engaged of object analysis?\r\n- What constitutes evidence(?) in this method? \r\n- (How) is it situated in and related to broader intellectual, social, cultural, political, economic contexts?\r\n- What worldview does this method operate within, generate, promote? What new questions and perspectives does it generate?\r\n\r\n• Questions for practicing with methods (sessions 4 and 5 of each cycle)\r\n- How does this method define, categorize, shape, delineate, draw boundaries around the object? \r\n- What does this method usefully illuminate about the object? \r\n- What elements of the object does it pay attention to? How does the object exceed the framework offered by the method? (Or: what questions does or can the method not ask or address, about this or other objects?)\r\n- What kinds of questions does this method generate beyond the scope of interpreting the object?\r\n- Reflect – is this method (only) a method?

Most academic subject areas and disciplines address issues of consciousness in some way: from biology and evolution to brain, mind and cognition, to perception and attention, emotion and affect, to history-making and remembering, to nationalism, spirituality, and political action. The study of consciousness in this interdisciplinary course offers opportunities to consider the relationships between consciousness and body, mind, self, culture and society from a number of disciplinary perspectives, including anthropology, biology, ecology, history, psychology, neuroscience, philosophy, literary studies, cultural studies, psychoanalysis and sociology.\r\n\r\nThe major questions addressed in this course include definitions of consciousness (What is consciousness? What does it mean to be conscious? What are the origins of consciousness?); how consciousness is situated in natural and social environments (Where is consciousness located? Do animals and plants exhibit consciousness? Can we enter another’s consciousness?); the effects of disruptions to consciousness (What happens if the connections between the brain, the sensory systems and self are disrupted or damaged?); how consciousness is culturally constructed (How does consciousness underpin the cultural, social, and political processes through which societies remember and reconstruct the past, present, and future?) and finally, the limits of consciousness (Can we alter or even transcend consciousness?)\r\n\r\nThe course is comprised of four units, each of which contains a Disciplinary Introduction (DI) through which students will become acquainted with substantive arguments and debates about consciousness from selected disciplinary perspectives, and an Interdisciplinary Space (IS) in which students are encouraged to collaborate, share knowledge, exchange ideas, and develop interdisciplinary skill sets.", "level": 200}}, {"model": "reviews.course", "pk": 182, "fields": {"name": "Big Questions in Language, Power & (dis)Empowerment", "code": "900201ACCY", "description": "Our unique ability to learn and speak a language might not be something that we are always aware of. Yet language interacts with every aspect of our life in society; it makes it possible for us to exchange information, to share our ideas, opinions and emotions. Precisely because of its all-pervasive nature and because it is such a unique characteristic of human beings, language – its origin, structure, uses, applications and power – has caught the attention of many scholars. For instance, neuroscientists relate human language to the organization, structure, and the intricate workings of our brain. Biologists are interested in the development of language in the individual, its origins, and evolution. Sociologists and psychologists are interested in the use of language to express a national or local identity. Literary scholars examine an author’s use of language to articulate their interpretation of a piece of literature. Cultural theorists explore the interaction between language and culture. This brief overview already reveals that language interacts with many of the disciplines that feature in AUC’s curriculum – or society at large – and that it can only be fully understood if it is considered in relation to society. To come to a full, holistic understanding of language, its uses and its power, this Big Questions course will take an interdisciplinary approach to this phenomenon, by first comparing and contrasting how language is used and studied in different disciplinary contexts and then attempting to integrate and synthesize these different views.\r\n\r\nIn the first half of the course, we will provide a basic understanding of the language system, focusing on meaning-making and language use. In the second part, we will elaborate on how language intersects with power, distinguishing between ‘the power behind language’ – recognising when language reveals power or reflects power – and ‘the power of language’ – recognising when language maintains existing dominance. We will approach this from different disciplinary perspectives (e.g. language through the eyes of linguists, psychologists, sociologists, anthropologists, computer scientists, biologists, philosophers and cultural theorists) with the aim to build a multi-disciplinary framework. In this context, we will also link the concepts of language and power to immigration, and the arguably linguistically, politically and culturally vulnerable position of immigrants. In the third part of the course, we will then take this multi-disciplinary framework as a starting point for an interdisciplinary inquiry by working collaboratively in interdisciplinary groups to explore how different (disciplinary) approaches shed light on the interplay between language and power, and how combining different views may provide a deeper, more holistic understanding than would be obtained by adopting a mono-disciplinary perspective. Each group will undertake an interdisciplinary project related to the themes of the course, involving research and a creative product (e.g., a podcast, a short movie, a policy proposal, etc).", "level": 200}}, {"model": "reviews.course", "pk": 183, "fields": {"name": "Big Questions in the Anthropocene", "code": "900205ACCY", "description": "The impact of humans on Earth measured and experienced in what is commonly referred to as the Anthropocene, brings us the questions: how and to what extent has human impact surpassed that of natural forces?’ How do we imagine and envision the Anthropocene?

What is required to survive in a context in which multiple scales of “violence” affect humans and non-humans alike?\r\n\r\nItself a highly contested term, the Anthropocene has been used not only to designate a geological epoch, but also as a means of framing a number of significant environmental, social, and cultural challenges that this period has brought with it.

The course is structured around three key themes: (1) resource management (food security, sustainability, energy); (2) cultural construction (rethinking and contextualizing human/nature relationships, Anthropocene as epoch); and (3) social action (the new economics of the Anthropocene, ethical dilemmas, politics).\r\n\r\nIn Big Questions in the Anthropocene, you will critically evaluate your relationship with the planet and study new ways and the cultures and practices that it sustains. Together, we will explore questions such as: how do our economies impact waste disposal and energy sources? In addition, we will examine technological innovations, debate ethical issues, and perform social analyses. As we interrogate the idea of the Anthropocene, we will also discuss and challenge related concepts and oppositions. These include the presumptive binary division between ‘nature’ and ‘humankind’; the myth of human domination over nature; and naturalized conceptualizations of time and history.\r\n\r\nTo effectively address the problems of the Anthropocene, you will develop a set of interdisciplinary tools and a broad understanding of the context and situations in which to apply them, as well as the potential of these tools to facilitate discussion and effect change.", "level": 200}}, {"model": "reviews.course", "pk": 184, "fields": {"name": "Big Questions in the Senses", "code": "900207ACCY", "description": "The senses transcend disciplinary, geographic and chronologic boundaries: they can be studied from the perspectives of anthropology, linguistics, biology, chemistry, psychology, philosophy, art and cultural history.

Ideally the senses should be approached from all of these perspectives, since perception is both a cultural and physiological disposition. Yet the senses – especially those referred to as ‘lower’ senses (smell, taste, touch) – are often overlooked as serious topics of study and as sources of knowledge. Besides our sense of sight, our other senses are not trained in an analytical sense, and we lack proper vocabularies to describe our sensory impressions. As a result, they are often undervalued or even excluded in modern societies, and in particular in academia.\r\n\r\nIn an increasingly digital and consequently audio-visual world, especially during the global coronavirus pandemic, it is more important than ever to both understand the senses from a multi-disciplinary perspective, to be able to analyze the visual input we are bombarded with, and to educate the senses we are neglecting.\r\n\r\nMedia theorist Walter Ong stated that ‘we would gain a truer understanding of other societies if we were to allow that their conceptions of the world may very well not fit into our visualist paradigms’.

Topics will include measuring time, historical development of the Time concept, deep time, space-time, time and age, the reality of the present, past and future, time as cultural concept, and time as a social construct.\r\n\r\nStudents will first explore the role and nature of time in their own discipline and then compare and contrast these concepts to those of other disciplines.\r\n\r\nMany of the problems society faces are in some way related to time.

Can rhetoric serve to create moral imaginaries? In this course, we will travel back in time to ancient Athens, a city-state that was obsessed with the power of rhetoric. Ancient Athens was a rowdy democracy where political gain crucially depended on the art of public speaking. Many teachers of rhetoric travelled to wealthy Athens in order to teach the ambitious elite the techniques and philosophies that would ensure success in politics and in life. This invited the great philosopher Plato (427-347 BCE) to ask important questions about the relationship between rhetoric, language, truth, meaning, and power. In this course, we will study several of Plato’s dialogues in order to reflect on questions such as: What is the art of rhetoric? Can rhetoric be separated from philosophy and morality? What is the power of words in politics? What is good rhetoric? The final week is dedicated to a specific kind of rhetoric, namely, the rhetoric of music, myths, and stories. We will ask questions such as is there a rhetoric of music? How do myths and stories relate to the emotions, and to the moral imagination?

A variety of media will be addressed, including investigation of the South African magazine, Drum, the Post-Impressionist Storm Society in China, and Brasília in Brazil.\r\n\r\nThe second half of the course will address international contemporary art, attending to case studies of artists who work globally—as opposed to focusing on particular locales—as so many contemporary artists do not confine their careers to their native countries, but rather live and work abroad. Identity is fluid, if not elusive, for many of these contemporary artists, so we will consider the contexts in which they operate, as well as the relationship between works of art and their sites of execution. Amongst the artists we will examine are Chinese artist Ai Weiwei, Iranian artist Shirin Neshat, and Columbian artist Doris Salcedo.\r\n\r\nThroughout the semester, we will confront issues of postcolonialism, multiculturalism, exoticism, identity, and the politics of the cross-cultural gaze.

Finally, also the ethical aspects of research are discussed, specifically concerning gene editing and the principles of open science.  \r\n\r\nIn the second part of the course, students develop practical skills in recombinant DNA technology and Biochemistry. The Molecular techniques used are the core of the Molecular Biology and Biochemistry fields and are often applied in biomedical- and cell biology research. The student will also be introduced to several bioinformatics tools and computer programs that are often used in these fields. The techniques in the course include: BLAST, (in silico) cloning, (colony)PCR, gel-electrophoresis, DNA digestion, ligation, transformation, sequencing, protein purification, enzymatic activity determination protein identification through mass spectrometry.
