# AUSee - Anonymous Course Reviews for AUC


## About AUSee

AUSee is an anonymous course review platform designed for students of Amsterdam University College (AUC). It allows students to share their honest opinions about courses while maintaining anonymity. The platform was built by a group of students with the goal of helping others make informed decisions about their course selections.


## Our Mission

We believe that **shared knowledge and experiences** can help the student community. By maintaining anonymity, we encourage openness and honest feedback while fostering a respectful and constructive environment. AUSee is built on the principle of a **horizontal, decentralized structure** where all students can actively participate in adding and moderating courses and reviews. Our goal is to create an anarchic, self-governing space where students **collectively maintain the platform**, ensuring **transparency** and inclusivity in course evaluations. We discourage features that centralize the power to moderate content.&#x20;


## Review Guidelines

While we support free speech, we ask all users to follow these guidelines:

- No hateful or discriminatory comments.
- Be honest but constructive.
- Provide clear and factual reviews to help other students.
- Follow our [Terms of Use](#) for more details.



## Disclaimer

The opinions expressed in the reviews are those of individual users and do not reflect the official views of the developers or AUC.
